[Code + Mortar](https://codeandmortar.com/) offers its team members a one month
sabbatical to do or learn something new. TJ, our Director of Product +
Innovation is taking the month of July, 2017 to dive into the wonderful world
of Unity Development.

[Unity](https://unity3d.com/) is a development platform focused primarily on 3D
game development that also has applications such as 360 and VR experiences and
2D game development. Unity can be deployed to just about any platform from web
and Facebook, to Android and iOS, to just about every modern gaming console from
Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft.

TJ is learning Unity from [Awesome Tuts](http://www.awesometuts.com/) at
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com). Follow along here and on Twitter
[@codeandmortar](https://twitter.com/codeandmortar) to stay up to date. TJ will
be posting regular updates with demo apps/games and vlogs on his experience.

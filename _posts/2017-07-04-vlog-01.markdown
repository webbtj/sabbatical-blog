So, today was day one of my sabbatical and I have to admit, I didn't think I'd
have anything "sharable" after just one day, especially given that day one
included a 4+ hour "intro" to C#. I managed to get a simple game up and running
and deployed for web within the first couple of hours. It's a pretty basic
"game", using the arrow keys or the WASD keys to control a pumpkin rolling
uphill towards a goal (the gate) while avoiding monsters. Collision with the
monsters or the goal stops the game, as does falling off the edge. So it is
obviously proof of concept, basically the Hello Worldâ„¢ of Unity applications.

So check out the Vlog to hear all about it, then load the game below to try it
out for yourself (again very rudimentary so restarting the game requires a page
refresh).
